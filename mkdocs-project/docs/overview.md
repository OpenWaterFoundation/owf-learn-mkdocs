# Learn MkDocs / Overview

There is often a need to create integrated static websites to organize documentation, visualizations, etc. and provide navigation between resources.
A static website consists of files that can be generated ahead of time and therefore doesnâ€™t
rely on back-end server programs to query databases or otherwise generate dynamic content.
A static website can include purely static files such as text, HTML, and images,
in which case the web browser simply displays pre-generated content.

The website also can be somewhat dynamic and utilize JavaScript that runs in a web browser to provide a dynamic look, such as interactive maps and graphs.
The data content can be static, or could be refreshed on the server where files are read.
For example, for a real-time application, the web browser application could refresh itself
every few minutes to utilize data files on a server that are updated.
The new content could, for example, be processed on a local computer and updated to
Amazon S3 or other could storage as a public website that can be accessed by links in the static website.

The above approaches can involve extensive programming using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and all the JavaScript libraries that are available).
However, doing so requires technical skills that many people do not have.
Another approach is to use a framework that processes simple input to create static websites with dynamic features like navigation menus.

MkDocs is a useful documentation tool that processes [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files into a static website.
The source Markdown files for the website are simple text files and images that can easily be maintained under version control.

MkDocs software is free and open source and only requires that Python is installed while editing the documentation
(Python is not needed to view the website when deployed to the cloud).
See:  [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).
This documentation is the result of using MkDocs.

The Open Water Foundation recommends using MkDocs for the following purposes:

* Software developer documentation - explain how to set up and use the development environment
* Software user documentation - provide navigable documentation with screen shots and examples
* Project documentation - use navigable static HTML website rather than only PDF documents

## Alternatives to MkDocs

Alternatives to MkDocs include [Sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)),
which uses reStructuredText source files rather than Markdown.
Alternatives should be considered should MkDocs not satisfy requirements.

## Next Steps

The remainder of this documentation describes how to install MkDocs software, set up a MkDocs documentation project,
edit and review documentation, and deploy the documentation to the web.
